In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur\u2014a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (\u201cOn the Extremes of Good and Evil\u201d), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.","text_style":"bty-fs-20-col-green-center","title":"About Us","title_style":"bty-fs-22-col-black-center"}}
